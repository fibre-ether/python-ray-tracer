# Python ray tracer
A simple ray tracer made in python 

This is just a basic implementation of a ray tracer I made as a project.

Inspired by Peter Shirley's book over at https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

Only diffuse, metal and light materials implemented. Multi-core processing used to speed up rendering.
Works slightly faster in linux or WSL as Ray starts up faster in linux.
