# Python ray tracer
A simple ray tracer made in python (WIP)

This is just a basic implementation of a ray tracer I made as a project.

Inspired by https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html
Only diffuse, metal and light materials implemented. Multi-core processing used to speed up rendering.
Works slightly faster in linux or WSL as Ray starts up faster in linux.
